To use the program you need to download/copy the raw codes of the 3 files (html,css,javascript) and open them with an ide then use a web browser to run the html file.
then you can use the program to calculate stuff
OR alternatively just download the zip file consisting of all files and open the html file in an ide  then your web browser will be opened and you see the application.
Thank you Enjoy.
